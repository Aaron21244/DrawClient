# DrawClient
This project consists of a simple Drawing Client similar to paint with the addition of extra features. This includes the ability to record the screen and audio, multiple drawing pages, save to a file, and play back the file in real time.

This project was made in NetBeans so apologies if this fails to compile else where.
